# EW
During the national power investment training, I am too boring. So I used pyqt and JavaScript to do the front-end page of power grid early-warning.

# Software Framework
1) Generating basic graphics using pyecharts
2) Using pyqt to build the basic framework of the homepage
3) Realize interactive communication between Python and JavaScript
4) Refresh page with timer
